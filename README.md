here's the completed code for the server-side endpoint that facilitates the signing process using MetaMask and stores the wallet address in MongoDB if it's valid:

This code defines a schema for storing wallet addresses in MongoDB, creates a model for the schema, and connects to the database. It also initializes an Express app, configures body parser middleware, and defines an endpoint for the signing process using MetaMask.

When the /sign endpoint is called, the code uses Web3 and MetaMask to verify the transaction and sign it with the MetaMask wallet. If the wallet address is valid, the code stores it in MongoDB using the Wallet model. Finally, the code returns the signed transaction to the client.

Note that this code assumes that the client is sending a POST request to the /sign endpoint with a JSON object that includes the transaction, walletAddress, and text properties. You'll need to modify this code to match your specific use case and requirements.
